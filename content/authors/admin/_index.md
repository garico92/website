I am a computational cosmologist with expertise in large-scale structure, numerical simulations, astrophysical processes in cosmology and machine learning applications
for data analysis. I aim to answer fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the validity of General Relativity at the largest scale of the Universe, and the physics of the formation of galaxies. To do so, I analyse multi-wavelength maps of the large-scale structure of the Universe using Bayesian inference. I optimise the extraction of information by developing new non-linear methods, which combine cosmological simulations, theoretical models of astrophysics, and machine learning techniques. 

I currently hold a senior postdoctoral position at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Bologna, Italy. 
Previously, I was a postdoc at the Institute for Computational Science at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. I obtained my  PhD from the University of Zaragoza, working at the Donostia International Physics Centre and the Centro de Estudios de Fisica del Cosmo de Aragón, in Spain. I was a visitor at MPA of Munich, at IMPU of Tokyo, and at Beecroft Institute, University of Oxford.  

I am author of more than 25 papers in international peer-reviewed journals (6 as first author), with over 1100 citations and an H-index of 18. I am a regular reviewer for Monthly Notices of Astronomical Society, The Astrophysical Journal, and The Open Journal of Astrophysics. 
I contributed to more than 40 international events, including conferences, meetings, workshops, panel discussions, seminars, and schools, 19 of which as an invited speaker, in Europe, Asia and America. I am a  member of the Euclid Collaboration, where I lead a Work Package and a Key Project that investigate baryonic physics.

I have a long experience operating with several high-performance computer facilities. I am the P.I. of a project awarded 6 million CPU hours in Marenostrum (Barcelon), and I am leading the Euclid Emulator 3 simulation project, which employed 72 million core hours on the Alps machine of the Swiss National Computer Centre (CSCS) to run one of the world's largest suite of cosmological simulations. I am a core member of the BACCO simulation project, which holds a world-leading position in cosmological simulations.
