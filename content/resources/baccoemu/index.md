abstract: BACCOemu provides a collection of emulators for large-scale structure statistics over a wide range of cosmologies. The emulators provide fast predictions for the linear cold- and total-matter power spectrum, the nonlinear cold-matter power spectrum, and the modifications to the cold-matter power spectrum caused by baryonic physics in a wide cosmological parameter space, including dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: BACCOemu is a software library providing neural-network emulators for cosmological large-scale structure statistics.
